 A robber was robbing a house...

A robber was robbing a house when he heard a voice. "Jesus is watching you!"
 "who's there?" The robber said But no sound was heard. So he kept going and
 he heard it two more times when he spotted a parrot. "What's your name,
" the robber asked. "Cocodora" said the parrot. "Now, what kind of idiot would
 name a bird Cocodora" said the robber. "The same idiot who named the rotweiler
 Jesus", said the parrot. 

 Who am I?

"Quick! My husband is back!" Man jumps out from a window. Flying down he

  A recent study showed...

A recent study showed that the average husband only actually speaks 
to his wife about thirty-seven minutes each week.

Well, yeah, I can believe that, I mean just how long does it take

Hungry Snake

Having arived at the edge of the river, the fisherman soon realized he had forgotten to bring any bait. Just then he happened to see a little snake passing by who had caught a worm. The fisherman snatched up the snake and robbed him of his worm. Feeling sorry for the little snake with no lunch, he snatched him up again and poured a little beer down his throat and went about his fishing.

An hour or so later the fisherman felt a tug at his pantleg. Looking down, he saw the same snake with three more worms in his mouth...

A man took his Rottweiler to the vet...

A man took his Rottweiler to the vet and said "My dog's cross- eyed, is there anything you can do for him?" "Well," said the vet, "lets have a look at him." So he picks the dog up and has a good look at its eyes. "Hmm," says the vet, "I'm going to have to put him down" "Just because he's cross-eyed?" says the man. "No, because he's heavy," says the vet.
