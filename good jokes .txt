A robber was robbing a house when he heard a voice. "Jesus is watching you!"
 "who's there?" The robber said But no sound was heard. So he kept going and
 he heard it two more times when he spotted a parrot. "What's your name,
" the robber asked. "Cocodora" said the parrot. "Now, what kind of idiot would
 name a bird Cocodora" said the robber. "The same idiot who named the rotweiler
 Jesus", said the parrot.

Night. A sleeping couple is lying in a bed. Door bell rings. A couple wakes up. Woman:

A recent study showed that the average husband only actually speaks

Well, yeah, I can believe that, I mean just how long does it take 
to say "Uh-huh" or "Yes dear" or "I'm sorry" ?
